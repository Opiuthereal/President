A 1 week video game (point and click) project made with Tkinter for a python course. <br /> 
Some visual elements in this project were inspired by the game "Please, Don't Touch Anything", developed by Four Quarters and published by BulkyPix. The game's minimalist art style and creative direction served as inspiration for the assets used here.
A big thanks to the creators for their work, which continues to spark creativity.

(Note: This project is independent and not affiliated with Four Quarters or BulkyPix in any way.)
